Welcome to my Java Programming Project repository! This GitHub repository serves as a dedicated space for storing my little Java projects as I embark on my journey to learn the Java programming language.

## Project Description

As a novice Java programmer, I am working on various small projects to grasp the fundamentals of Java and enhance my programming skills. This repository contains multiple Java programs, each addressing different concepts and functionalities.

## BMI Calculation

The `BMI_Calculation` Java program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. It prompts the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) and then calculates and displays the BMI value. This simple program can be a helpful tool for health-conscious individuals who want to keep track of their BMI.

## Leap Year Checker

The `LeapYear` Java program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It asks the user to input a year, and based on the leap year rules, it determines if the provided year is a leap year or a common year.

## Lottery Game

The `Lottery` Java program generates a random 2 digits number. The user will input a number of his/her choice, if the number matches the lottery, the user will be rewarded €30,000, if only one digit matches, the user will be rewarded €3,000, if one digit match even in a different order, the user will be rewarded €1,000.

## Zodiac Finder

The `zodiac` program to find out the Chinese Zodiac sign for a given year. The Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal—monkey, rooster, dog, pig, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, or sheep.

## Quadratic Equations Solver

The `quadraticEquationsSolver` is a simple Java program that allows users to solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The program takes input for coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' from the user and then calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. Based on the discriminant, the program outputs the results indicating the number and values of the roots.

## Angle Computation for a Triangle

The `ComputeAngles` is a Java program computes the angles of a triangle given the coordinates of its three vertices. The user is prompted to enter the x and y coordinates for each point, and the program calculates the lengths of the sides and subsequently the angles using trigonometric formulas.

## FullNameSeparator

The `FullNameSeparator` program is a simple Java application that takes user input for a full name (first name and last name) and separates it into individual components. It utilizes the Scanner class to read user input, finds the index of the space character to identify the separation between first and last names, and then extracts and displays both components. This program demonstrates basic string manipulation and input handling in Java.

## MultiplicationTable

The `MultiplicationTable` program generates a multiplication table and prints it to the console. It's a simple yet educational example that showcases nested loops and formatting in Java programming. The program starts by printing the header and column labels, followed by a formatted grid of multiplication results from 1x1 to 9x9. It serves as a great introductory code snippet for those learning about loops and basic formatting in Java.

Key features:

Demonstrates the use of nested loops for table generation.
Utilizes printf for neatly formatting the multiplication results.
Enhances understanding of control structures and console output manipulation in Java.

## GreatestCommonDivisor

The `greatestCommonDivisor` program prompts the user to input two integers and calculates their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder. This program employs a simple iterative method to find the GCD.

Key features:

Demonstrates the use of nested loops for table generation.
Utilizes printf for neatly formatting the multiplication results.
Enhances understanding of control structures and console output manipulation in Java.

## Java Palindrome Checker

This Java program prompts the user to input a string and then checks if the entered string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). If the input string qualifies as a palindrome, the program will print "[input string] is a palindrome", otherwise it will print "[input string] is not a palindrome".

Features:

Utilizes a two-pointer approach to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string.
Efficiently breaks out of the loop as soon as a non-matching character pair is found.
Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
Perfect for beginners trying to understand string manipulations and basic algorithms in Java.

## Contributing

I'm using this repository primarily for my personal learning journey in Java programming, and I am not actively seeking contributions at this time. However, if you have suggestions, improvements, or found any issues in the code, you're welcome to open an issue or reach out to me via email (zhongm@tcd.ie).
