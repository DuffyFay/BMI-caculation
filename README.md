Welcome to my Java Programming Project repository! This GitHub repository serves as a dedicated space for storing my little Java projects as I embark on my journey to learn the Java programming language.

## Project Description

As a novice Java programmer, I am working on various small projects to grasp the fundamentals of Java and enhance my programming skills. This repository contains multiple Java programs, each addressing different concepts and functionalities.

## BMI Calculation

The `BMI_Calculation` Java program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. It prompts the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) and then calculates and displays the BMI value. This simple program can be a helpful tool for health-conscious individuals who want to keep track of their BMI.

## Leap Year Checker

The `LeapYear` Java program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It asks the user to input a year, and based on the leap year rules, it determines if the provided year is a leap year or a common year.
